// Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners
// about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For
// now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
// A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years
// old.
// Your tasks:
// Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
// ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
// 1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have
// cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat
// ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)
// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1
// is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy")
function checkDogs (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
    // 1
    let newDogsJulia = dogsJulia.slice(1, 3); // [1, 3)
    console.log(`dog data of Julia:`, newDogsJulia);
    // 2
    let dogs = newDogsJulia.concat(dogsKate);
    console.log(`both dog data: ${dogs}`);
    // 3.
    dogs.forEach((dog, i) => {
        console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is ${dog >= 3 ? 'an adult' : 'still a puppy'}, and is ${dog} years old`);
    });
}

// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// / ยง Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
let dogsJulia = [3, 5, 2, 12, 7];
let dogsKate = [4, 1, 15, 8, 3];
checkDogs(dogsJulia, dogsKate);

console.log(`\n`);
// ยง Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
let dogsJuliaD2 = [9, 16, 6, 8, 3];
let dogsKateD2 = [10, 5, 6, 1, 4];
